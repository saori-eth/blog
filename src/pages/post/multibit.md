# MultiBit Bridge: $MUBI

Multibit bridges BRC-20 tokens to EVM networks.

## Utility

- Governance
- Staking
  - "Stake for liquidity, earn ERC20 or BRC20" (presumably more $MUBI)
  - Doesn't exist yet
  - Also in future can stake for $ORDI

## Stats

- 883,424,150 tokens mostly diluted
  - They minted with their bridge factory and can never renounce the ability to mint
- In the first week, there was about $17mm bridge volume
  - about 90% is in the native token
- Flat bridge fee
  - 0.01 ETH when sending from Ethereum
  - 0.08 Sats when sending from Bitcoin
  - None shared with holders
- Analogs ($15mm fdv time of writing)
  - ACX $80mm fdv. $20mm volume / day
  - STG $522mm fdv. $10mm volume / day
  - HOP $30mm fdv. $3mm volume / day

## Random

- Geoblocks US users, makes you sign agreement
- Bridge secured by multisig
- Everything from token supply to fees charged is undocumented

## Impression

Going to keep an eye on the bridge [volume](https://app.multibit.exchange/bridge).
Unfortunately, Everything deployed by the dev other than the token is unverified.
I will update this post if I find the ethereum bridge address because it would be easy to monitor transfers to it.

Generally, I believe the developers are retarded, but I understand why people are into this token given the rapid increase in onchain Bitcoin activity.
